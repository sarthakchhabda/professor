          <h3>10 Tips for CA Inter Taxation Preparation</h3>

            <ol>
              <li>Try to do the syllabus at least 2-3 times before exams.</li>
              <li>Divide your available days/months into a number of revisions and among all subjects.</li>
              <li>Ensure that the target is challenging, achievable, and in line with the overall study plan.</li>
              <li>Try to give many mock tests.</li>
              <li>Make notes containing formulas and concepts.</li>
              <li>Study only 1 or 2 subjects in a day.</li>
              <li>Start a subject, complete it in a few days, and then start with a new subject.</li>
              <li>The reading time in the examination should first and foremost be used to decide which questions are to be attempted and which question has to be left.</li>
              <li>Using a single book ensures that one has limited points to study in the final revision, and it becomes easy to remember things.</li>
              <li>Targets should not be formed in terms of “I have to study these many hours today”.</li>
            </ol>

          <h3>Why traditional way of coaching for CA would not work any more.</h3>

            <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere are many ways to go about studying for the professional courses like CA, CS and CMA. You could try physical coaching classes.  You could try pen drive lectures. Or you could sign up for live online classes hosted on an e-learning platform of your choice. (We will talk about what an e-learning platform is later in the post).
               You could buy online courses that comprise of pre-recorded online video lectures hosted on an e-learning platform. (For the sake of convenience, we will refer to e-learning platforms/portals as e-learning apps from now on.)
               Or even some sort of combination of all these options.
               But with these many choices available for you, which is the best? As we said earlier, for the motivated student it appears that pre-recorded online video lectures is. Especially if the e-learning portal upon which the lectures are hosted has certain features.
               Before we go through all the advantages/disadvantages, let’s get an idea of what coaching classes, pen drive classes and e-learning apps are all about.
